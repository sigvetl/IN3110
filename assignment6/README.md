## web_visualization.py
### __Requirements:__
This module requires the following packages installed:
__pandas:__
install with: _"pip install pandas"_
__altair:__
install with: _"pip install altair"_
__flask:__
install with: _"pip install flask"_

Additionally requires the files in the folders data, docs and templates to be located in the same directory as the script

This script starts a web server on localhost when the script is run with the command _"python3 web_visualization.py"_
This webserver loads a chart showing daily and cumulative cases of covid-19 in all counties. The page contains a dropdown list of counties in Norway the plot can be shown for by selecting the county and clicking "select". The new plot is loaded on the main page.
If you want to se a visual representation of covid-19 cases per 100k inhabitants for each country, the button "Show map" takes you to an extension and generates such a plot.
The documentation for the module is available by clicking "Show help page"

The module contains two functions that are not used by the web server. This is plot_reported_cases and plot_cumulative_cases. This is because the plot used by the web server works independently of these functions. As the web server plot shows the combined information generated by these functions, i saw no need to include these plots on the web server.
