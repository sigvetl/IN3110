Timing : numba_color2sepia using rain.jpg with dimensions (400,600,3).
Average runtime running numba_color2sepia after 3 runs : 0,2473134995 s.
Average runtime for running numba_color2sepia is 44,8 times
faster than python_color2sepia.py.
Average runtime for running numba_color2sepia is 4,3 times
slower than numpy_color2sepia.py
Timing performed using : time.time()

note
The second and third running time of the function is considerably faster than the first
as it is executing from cache. Running it three individual times would yield a poorer result
